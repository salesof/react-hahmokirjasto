Tabletop roleplaying game character library with React and node.js

I developed this project during two weeks as my training project for a web development course. This project is meant for Age of the Tempest tabletop roleplaying game as it uses the character sheet used in this particular game. The game's homepage can be found here: https://myrskynsankarit.wordpress.com/

I have created this website with XAMPP's Apache web server and MySQL Database using React, Vite, node.js, express, bcrypt, cors and multer.

Use npm run dev command in react-hahmokirjasto folder and npm start in backend folder to start the project.
